## Description

To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:

```volume = Length * Width * Height```
    
But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).

Return `true` if the cuboid could have equal sides, return `false` otherwise.

Return `false` for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).

Note: side will be an integer
