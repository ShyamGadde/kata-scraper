## Description

Define a method ```hello``` that ```returns``` "Hello, Name!" to a given ```name```, or says Hello, World! if name is not given (or passed as an empty String).

Assuming that ```name``` is a ```String``` and it checks for user typos to return a name with a first capital letter (Xxxx).

Examples:
```
* With `name` = "john"  => return "Hello, John!"
* With `name` = "aliCE" => return "Hello, Alice!"
* With `name` not given 
  or `name` = ""        => return "Hello, World!"
```
