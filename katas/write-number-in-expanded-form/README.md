# Write Number in Expanded Form

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in [Expanded Form](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/expanded-notation.html). For example:

```
expandedForm(12)    --> should return "10 + 2"
expandedForm(42)    --> should return "40 + 2"
expandedForm(70304) --> should return "70000 + 300 + 4"
```

NOTE: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.
