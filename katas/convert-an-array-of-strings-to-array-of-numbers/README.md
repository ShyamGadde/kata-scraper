## Description

## Oh no!
Some really funny web dev gave you a _sequence of numbers_ from his API response as an _sequence of strings_!

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

ie:``` ["1", "2", "3"] ``` to ``` [1, 2, 3] ```

Note that you can receive floats as well.
