## Description

This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.


~~~if:csharp
`Point` objects have fields `X` and `Y`.
~~~
~~~if-not:csharp
`Point` objects have attributes `x` and `y`.
~~~

Write a function calculating distance between `Point a` and `Point b`.

Tests compare expected result and actual answer with tolerance of `1e-6`.
